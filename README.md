📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset is based on the Global Superstore Sales (demo/fake business data commonly used for BI projects). It includes:

Order Details (Date, ID, Shipping Mode, Priority)

Customer Info (Segment, Region, Country)

Product Info (Category, Sub-category)

Financial Metrics (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount)

📊 Insights Gained
Consumer Segment brings in the highest revenue.

Technology products outperform other categories in both sales and profit.

West and East regions show strong performance.

Sales peak around November–December, likely due to holiday season demand.

Standard shipping is preferred, but there’s potential to push Same-Day or First-Class options for higher margins.

📈 Future Improvements
Add real-time data integration with Power Query or Power BI.

Use VBA to automate data refresh or custom interactions.

Deploy a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard.

Connect Excel with a SQL database for larger datasets.
